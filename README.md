# Prosper_PRN_Reader
Prosper can export data in multiple formats, for a large choice of analisys and variables; it's almost impossible to code a single parser for all PRN contents.
This notebook allows parsing a report of the "Results" section containing VLP and IPR information for defined sensitivity cases.
It gives you a clear idea of the main functions required, an dyou should be able to modify it to suit your needs.
The data for all cases is captured in a list, which can then be easily processed for your particular use.
